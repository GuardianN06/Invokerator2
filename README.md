# Invokerator2
Launches apps as invoker if command prompt and powershell is disabled on your system.

This takes a spin on the Invokerator I made before, by modifying the command prompt so that if there's AppLocker rules that take the hash of cmd, then this program will bypass them and runs the program as invoker.
